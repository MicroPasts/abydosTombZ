This application enables the transcription of archive cards from the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) Abydos Tomb cards 
Cemetery Z archive. Images will be drawn from the EES Flickr feed and redisplayed in the browser window. The EES would 
like the following information to be transcribed for them to create a searchable archive for their records. 

These fields are:

* Excavator's or finder's name
* Date of discovery
* Record number
* Descriptive data
* Whether the card maybe a reverse

The object cards have been scanned by EES volunteers.
